Inferring properties of the solar atmosphere from the spectropolarimetric observations using neural networks

Ivan Milic (Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics - KIS)

The solar spectrum holds information about the depth stratification of the physical parameters in the solar atmosphere: temperature, pressure, velocity, and the magnetic field. Therefore, the interpretation of the spatially resolved spectroscopic (or spectropolarimetric) gives us access to the three-dimensional distribution of the physical parameters in the atmosphere of the Sun. The methods to carry out such inference are called spectropolarimetric inversions. These are approaches that fit a highly sophisticated physical model of the solar atmosphere to the observed spectrum and its polarization. In this talk and the accompanying hands-on exercise, we will see how to use an existing dataset of simulated solar atmospheres and the corresponding spectra, to devise a simple neural network that can replace standard inversion. We will see that, after the initial training, such a network performs extremely fast and has comparable results to the standard inversion techniques.
